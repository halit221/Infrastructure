Create a new PriorityClass named high-priority for user-workloads with a value that is one less than the highest existing user-defined priority class value. 
Patch the existing Deployment busybox-logger running in the priority namespace to use the high-priority priority class.

Ensure that the busybox-logger Deployment rolls out successfully with the new priority class set.

It is expected that Pods from other Deployments running in the priority namespace are evicted.

Do not modify other Deployments running in the priority namespace.
Failure to do so may result in a reduced score.
