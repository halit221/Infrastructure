Create a new HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) named apache-server in the autoscale namespace. 
This HPA must target the existing Deployment called apache-server in the autoscale namespace.

Set the HPA to target for 50% CPU usage per Pod.
â€¢ Configure hpa to have at min 1 Pod and no more than 4 Pods[max]. 
Also, we have to set the downscale stabilization window to 30 seconds.
