Migrate an existing web application from Ingress to Gateway API.
We must maintain HTTPSaccess.

A GatewayClass named nginx is installed in the cluster.

First, create a Gateway named web-gateway with hostname gateway.web.k8s.local that maintains the existing TLS and listener configuration from the existing ingress resource named web.

Next, create an HTTPRoute named web-route with hostname gateway.web.k8s.local that maintains the existing routing rules from the current Ingress resource named web.

You can test your Gateway API configuration with the following command:
[candidate@cka2025] $ curl https: //gateway.web.k8s.local

Finally, delete the existing Ingress resource named web.
